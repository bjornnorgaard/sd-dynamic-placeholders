# Agent guidance — placeholder lists

This repo ships text lists under `placeholders/` for Stable Diffusion prompt tokens (`__name__`). When creating or editing those lists, optimize for **image-model distinguishability**, not geographic or taxonomic completeness.

## Core rule: variety without redundancy

Each line must produce a **visually different** result from every other line in the same file when sampled by a typical Stable Diffusion model.

- Prefer **fewer, sharper entries** over long near-duplicate catalogs.
- If two entries would likely share the same skyline, street fabric, climate palette, or architectural family, **keep only the most distinctive one**.
- Descriptors help, but they do not rescue lookalikes — models often ignore fine landmark wording and fall back to a generic regional look.

### Cities / places (hard lesson)

Do **not** list every capital (or city) in a region. East Asian capitals such as Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, and Pyongyang are a classic failure mode: the model will not reliably tell them apart. Same for clusters like Central European Gothic cities, Nordic harbor capitals, Andean highland cities, Gulf desert towers, or Caribbean coastal towns.

Pick **one exemplar per visual family**, worldwide coverage by contrast — not by count.

Bad: Tokyo + Seoul + Beijing + Pyongyang  
Good: Tokyo (and leave the rest of that visual family out)

Bad: Prague + Budapest + Vienna + Warsaw  
Good: one Central / Imperial European look, or skip the cluster if another European entry already covers it

## Applies to every placeholder category

Same logic for professions, settings, clothes, hair, expressions, lighting, etc.:

| Prefer | Avoid |
|---|---|
| Distinct silhouettes, materials, climates, eras | Near-synonyms and slight variants |
| Entries that change composition or palette | Exhaustive regional / taxonomic coverage |
| Short signature cues the model already knows | Long landmark laundry lists hoping to force a difference |

Before adding a line, ask: *If this and an existing line both got sampled, would the images look interchangeable?* If yes, do not add it — replace or drop.

## Namespacing

Organize lists in folders so related tokens read as a tree. Prefer nesting under an umbrella over dumping new roots into `placeholders/`.

| Umbrella | Lives under | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Place | `location/` | `location/castle/ballroom.txt`, `location/laboratory/main_lab.txt` |
| Character | `character/` | `character/heroine/game/ff7.txt`, `character/villain/movie/star_wars.txt` |
| Face features | `face/` | `face/eyes/color.txt`, `face/eyebrows.txt`, `face/facial_hair.txt` |
| Body | `body/` | `body/age.txt`, `body/hands.txt`, `body/marking/tattoo.txt` |
| Clothes zones | `clothes/` | `clothes/legs/pants.txt`, `clothes/hands/gloves.txt` |
| Props | `prop/` | `prop/held.txt`, `prop/furniture.txt` |
| Magic | `magic/` | `magic/element.txt`, `magic/effect.txt` |

- Token name = path without extension; nested folders use `/`.
- Root composers (`location.txt`, `clothes.txt`, `face.txt`, `character.txt`, `prop.txt`, `magic.txt`) pick **one** mutually exclusive family per line so layers never stack.
- Short-path resolution: unique leaf / suffix names also match (`__eyes__` → `face/eyes.txt`, `__ballroom__` → `location/castle/ballroom.txt`, `__age__` → `body/age.txt`). If two files share a basename, short-path fails — rename for uniqueness or require a fuller path.
- Prefer unique basenames for leaves users will pin often.
- Avoid parallel composers that share a basename (e.g. do not ship both `body/hands.txt` and `clothes/hands.txt` — gloves live at `clothes/hands/gloves.txt` so `__hands__` stays unique for body).

### What may live at the root

Keep the root reserved for:

1. **Shared primitives** — `color`, `size`, `length`, `material`, `fabric`, `pattern`
2. **Cross-cutting shot / style / mood** — `view`, `focus`, `pose`, `lighting`, `time`, `weather`, `era`, `atmosphere`, `artstyle`, `artist`, `photostyle`, `game`, `situation`
3. **Flat subject families** that are not trees yet — `profession`, `race`, `animal`, `monster`, `plant`, `skin`, `makeup`, `expression`, `armor`, `weapon`
4. **Umbrella composers** that only delegate — `character`, `location`, `clothes`, `face`, `body`, `hair`, `vehicle`, `prop`, `magic`, `random`

New multi-file families should get a folder + composer (`prop/`, `magic/`, `body/marking/`, `location/office/`, …), not a pile of sibling roots.

### Shared vs local attributes

Top-level shared lists:

- `__color__` — base palette
- `__size__` — generic scale
- `__length__` — generic length
- `__material__` — hard surfaces (metal, stone, wood, glass, …)
- `__fabric__` — cloth / soft goods
- `__pattern__` — prints and repeating designs

Domain files should **compose** these (`__fabric__` as a line, `__material__ plate armor`, `__pattern__ __fabric__ blouse`) and add only domain-only extras. Do not duplicate the shared palette inside every namespace.

Typical composition homes:

| Primitive | Compose into |
|---|---|
| `__color__` | `hair/color`, `face/eyes/color`, lip colors, accents |
| `__fabric__` / `__pattern__` | clothes zones (shirt, pants, fullbody, scarf, gloves, jacket) |
| `__material__` | armor, shoes/boots, furniture props, hard outerwear |

## Token boundaries & familiarity

Do not dump lookalikes across adjacent tokens. Prefer the sharper home for the entry:

| Token | Keep | Leave out |
|---|---|---|
| `__monster__` | Horror / pop-culture icons with dread | Simple beasts (`__animal__`), flora (`__plant__`), RPG types like vampire (`__race__`), plain human slashers |
| `__plant__` | Distinct flora / botanical silhouettes | Outdoor biomes (`__outdoor__`), movie jungles (`__scene__`) |
| `__game__` | Breakthrough franchise looks | Near-clone genres and niche titles |
| `__artist__` | Named animators / cartoonists / internet illustrators | Bare mediums (`__artstyle__`), oil painters, photographers |
| `__makeup__` | Full-face cosmetic looks | Bare lip color (`__lips__`), expression blush, tattoos (`__marking__`) |
| `__marking__` | Tattoos, scars, birthmarks, brands | Skin tone (`__skin__`), makeup, temporary paint |
| `__prop__` | Held / furniture / small objects | Weapons (`__weapon__`), worn bags/gloves (`__clothes__`) |
| `__magic__` | Elemental power and spell visuals | Lighting setups (`__lighting__`), weather (`__weather__`) |
| `__era__` | Period costume / culture looks | Clock time of day (`__time__`), place set pieces (`__scene__/period`) |
| `__atmosphere__` | Scene emotional tone | Facial expression (`__expression__`), lighting technique, weather |
| `__expression__` | Face emotion / expression | Scene mood (`__atmosphere__`) |
| `__hands__` | Hand anatomy / look | Gestures (`__pose__`), gloves (`__gloves__`) |
| `__location/outdoor__` | Biomes / environments | Movie set pieces (`location/scene`), dwelling rooms |
| `__location/scene__` | Film / animation tropes | Outdoor biomes, named cities, office/lab room trees |
| Character icons | Named heroes, villains, historical figures, celebrities | Generic professions (`__profession__`) |

When a list is meant for named cultural icons (monsters, games, heroes, villains, celebrities), prefer **broadly familiar** exemplars over niche completeness. One short signature cue after the name is enough — do not pad with landmark laundry lists.

## File conventions

- One replacement phrase per line; `#` comments and blank lines are ignored.
- Match existing style: short, no leading `a`/`an`/`the`, lead with the main noun.
- Header comments should state the token, intended prompt slots, and the distinctiveness rule.
- New **families** (new umbrella roots or major namespaces): add the lists, then a short note in `docs/placeholders.md` and a demo in `docs/examples.md` if useful. Do **not** catalog every leaf file in the docs — the folder tree is the catalog.
- After adding families, update `__random__` recipes so they exercise the new tokens without violating mutual exclusions.
