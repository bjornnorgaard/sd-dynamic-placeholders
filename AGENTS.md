# Agent guidance — placeholder lists

This repo ships text lists under `placeholders/` for Stable Diffusion prompt tokens (`__name__`). When creating or editing those lists, optimize for **image-model distinguishability**, not geographic or taxonomic completeness.

## Core rule: variety without redundancy

Each line must produce a **visually different** result from every other line in the same file when sampled by a typical Stable Diffusion model.

- Prefer **fewer, sharper entries** over long near-duplicate catalogs.
- If two entries would likely share the same skyline, street fabric, climate palette, or architectural family, **keep only the most distinctive one**.
- Descriptors help, but they do not rescue lookalikes — models often ignore fine landmark wording and fall back to a generic regional look.

### Cities / places (hard lesson)

Do **not** list every capital (or city) in a region. East Asian capitals such as Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, and Pyongyang are a classic failure mode: the model will not reliably tell them apart. Same for clusters like Central European Gothic cities, Nordic harbor capitals, Andean highland cities, Gulf desert towers, or Caribbean coastal towns.

Pick **one exemplar per visual family**, worldwide coverage by contrast — not by count.

Bad: Tokyo + Seoul + Beijing + Pyongyang  
Good: Tokyo (and leave the rest of that visual family out)

Bad: Prague + Budapest + Vienna + Warsaw  
Good: one Central / Imperial European look, or skip the cluster if another European entry already covers it

## Applies to every placeholder category

Same logic for professions, settings, clothes, hair, expressions, lighting, etc.:

| Prefer | Avoid |
|---|---|
| Distinct silhouettes, materials, climates, eras | Near-synonyms and slight variants |
| Entries that change composition or palette | Exhaustive regional / taxonomic coverage |
| Short signature cues the model already knows | Long landmark laundry lists hoping to force a difference |

Before adding a line, ask: *If this and an existing line both got sampled, would the images look interchangeable?* If yes, do not add it — replace or drop.

## File conventions

- One replacement phrase per line; `#` comments and blank lines are ignored.
- Match existing style: short, no leading `a`/`an`/`the`, lead with the main noun.
- Header comments should state the token (`__city__`), intended prompt slots, and the distinctiveness rule.
- Token name = path under `placeholders/` without extension (`city.txt` → `__city__`).
