# Dynamic Placeholders

A [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge - Neo](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic/tree/neo) extension that turns prompt tokens into random phrase expansions from plain text files.

**Only tested with Forge Neo.** It may work on other Automatic1111-compatible frontends, but that is unsupported.

Write lists under `placeholders/`, then use `__name__` in a prompt. At generation time each token is replaced with a random line from the matching file. Nested tokens inside those lines expand recursively, so one high-level placeholder can compose hair, clothes, setting, and more from smaller lists.

```
__focus__, __view__, __artstyle__ of a __race__ __profession__, __country__, with a __expression__, __face__, __hair__, __clothes__, in a __setting__ in __city__ at __time__
```

## Features

- Dedicated `placeholders/` folder for list files
- One random line per token — no combinatorial explosion
- List lines are phrases and sentences, not only single words
- Nested composition (`__hair__`, `__clothes__`, `__face__`, `__room__`, …)
- Shipped lists tuned for **visual distinctiveness** in image models

## Install

1. Copy or clone this folder into your Forge Neo `extensions/` directory:

   ```
   .../Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge - Neo/extensions/sd-dynamic-placeholders/
   ```

2. Restart the WebUI (Stability Matrix → restart package, or rerun `webui.sh`).

3. Confirm **Dynamic Placeholders** appears as an accordion under the txt2img / img2img generation controls.

No extra Python packages are required.

## Quick start

1. Open the **Dynamic Placeholders** accordion and leave **Enable** checked. The collapsed **How to use** section is a short in-UI overview.
2. Use a prompt with tokens, for example:

   ```
   portrait of __profession__ with __hair__, __clothes__, in a __setting__
   ```

3. Edit the shipped lists under `placeholders/`, or add new `.txt` files. Changes are picked up on the next generation (mtime-based cache — no restart).

4. In the prompt box, type `__` to autocomplete placeholder names (arrow keys / Enter or Tab to insert `__name__`).

Composition is built in: `__hair__` expands into length / color / style; `__clothes__` into separates or full-body outfits; `__face__` into structure plus features; `__room__` into type with optional size / mood / place. Details: [docs/SYNTAX.md](docs/SYNTAX.md).
