# Settings & UI

## Script accordion (txt2img / img2img)

| Control | Effect |
|---|---|
| Enable | Master switch for the current generation |
| Link seed to placeholder choices | Same seed → same replacements (reproducible) |
| Additional placeholders directory | Optional second folder searched after the default/settings directory (default wins on name conflicts). Use **Save directory** to keep it across restarts. |
| How to use | Collapsed quick-start overview (syntax, list files, composition, settings) |

## Settings page

**Settings → Dynamic Placeholders**

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Placeholders directory | extension `placeholders/` | Where list files live (empty = default) |
| Additional placeholders directory | _(empty)_ | Optional second folder (same as the script accordion field) |
| Placeholder wrap string | `__` | Characters around the name |
| Maximum nested replacement depth | `8` | Cap for recursive expansion |
| Leave unknown placeholders unchanged | on | Missing files keep `__name__` in the prompt |
| Save original template in generation parameters | on | Writes template into PNG info |
| Also expand placeholders in negative prompts | on | Same expansion as the positive prompt |
| Also expand placeholders in Hires. fix prompts | on | Expands placeholders in HR prompts |

## Directories

Default root:

```
extensions/sd-dynamic-placeholders/placeholders/
```

Override under **Settings → Dynamic Placeholders → Placeholders directory**, or add an extra folder in the script accordion and click **Save directory**. The extra path is stored in the extension’s `user_settings.json` (and synced to WebUI settings when possible) so it survives restarts.

Search order when an additional directory is set:

1. Primary placeholders directory (settings / default)
2. Additional directory

On name conflicts, the **primary** file wins.

## Autocomplete

Typing `__` in a prompt (or negative / HR prompt) opens a list of available placeholder names. Choose one to insert a closed token such as `__hair__` or `__clothes/torso/shirt__`.

- **Built-in:** works without other extensions. Uses the wrap string and placeholders directory from Settings.
- [Tag Autocomplete](https://github.com/DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete): if that extension is installed with wildcard search enabled, it owns `__` completion instead. This extension keeps a `wildcards/` symlink to `placeholders/` so Tag Autocomplete can discover the same lists.

## How it works (Forge Neo)

On Forge Neo this extension registers an `AlwaysVisible` script and rewrites `p.all_prompts` (and optional negative / HR prompts) inside `Script.process()`, after `setup_prompts()` and before sampling.

Each `__token__` is resolved independently (two `__expression__` tokens can become two different faces). With seed linking enabled, sampling is driven by the image seed so reruns match. The unresolved template stays in the UI / PNG info when that setting is on. Missing list files or an empty placeholders directory produce clear console warnings.
