# Shipped placeholders

Token name = path under `placeholders/` without the extension (`city.txt` → `__city__`). Nested folders use `/` in the token (`hair/color.txt` → `__hair/color__`).

You can use a parent alone (`__hair__`) and let composition pull in children, or pin a child token directly (`__hair/color__`).

### Clothes

`clothes.txt` keeps **separates** (torso + pants) and **full-body** outfits on different lines so layers never stack. Head and torso are themselves nested groups (`hat` / `glasses` / `piercings`, `shirt` / `jacket`).

Child lists under `placeholders/clothes/`:

- `head/` — `hat`, `glasses`, `piercings` (composed by `head.txt`)
- `torso/` — `shirt`, `jacket` (composed by `torso.txt`)
- plus `scarf`, `fullbody`, `pants`, `shoes`, `accessories`, `jewelry`

### Face

`face.txt` mixes structure with optional feature groups (`__eyes__`, `__nose__`, `__lips__`, `__ears__`) so prompts stay light when you omit layers. Each feature group nests size / shape / color / adjective lists the same way hair does.

### Room vs setting vs location

`room.txt` composes indoor locations from `type` with optional `size`, `mood`, and `place` (dwelling context). Use `__room__` for dwelling interiors, `__setting__` for outdoor / environment backdrops, and `__location__` for stereotypical movie and animation scene places (diner, school hallway, spaceship bridge, and similar).

### View, focus, pose, situation

`__view__` covers angle and composition; `__focus__` covers how much of the figure is in frame; `__pose__` covers how the body is held; `__situation__` covers what is happening — keep them separate so they do not fight.

## File format (short)

- One replacement per line (words, phrases, or full sentences)
- Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored
- Supported extensions: `.txt`, `.text`, `.list`
- A list entry may itself contain placeholders; they expand recursively
